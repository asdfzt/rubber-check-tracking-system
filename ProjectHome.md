Because rubber (bounced) checks occur so frequently in the grocery store business, a
tracking system is necessary to primarily collect the amount of the check. There are several
companies who offer these check collecting services but, the one Mr. Jones chose was
keeping the collection fee as their payment. Not to mention their guidelines were very strict
in who they would actually try to collect the bounced checks from. Therefore, Mr. Jones
would like a way to collect the bounced checks and the fees himself and essentially, “cut out
the middleman.”
